- DOM manipulation: changing the DOM based on the results of the HTTP requests.
- Learn to aggregate and parse data fetched from an api.


## Specifications

- the user can enter the city of their choice.
- On clicking the SUBMIT button or pressing ENTER the application will display the weather for the next 5 days.
- Remember the user choice on subsequent visits.
- Allow the user to compare the weather in multiple cities simultaneously.
- Use the API of https://unsplash.com/ to show a photo of the city they entered in the form.


## Instructions

1. Create an account on OpenWeather and generate an API key.
2. Use the native JS fetch() method to get weather data.
3. Good to know: Protect your tokens, API keys, and secrets.

## Nice-to-Have Suggestions
